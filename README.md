# constructor-word-guess

My attempt at converting the word guessing game into object oriented set of files. Did not finish some of input validation and game conditions. Right now the program randomly selects a letter, takes in a user input, and fills in the letter if it is correct, and returns incorrect if it is wrong, returning the full string with the underscores.
